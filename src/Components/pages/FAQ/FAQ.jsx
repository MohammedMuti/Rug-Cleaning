            question="How Are Pet Stains And Odours Treated?"
            answer="Pet urine never really dries, because dogs and cats donâ€™t sweat their urine contains alkaline salts which absorb moisture out of the air. This becomes a fedding ground for bacteria which causes odour staining and discolouration. Minor conditions are treated with germicidal and enzyme surface treatments. Major conditions may require pad replacement on upholstery, floor and backing treatment and underlay replacement on carpeted areas."
